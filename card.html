			<p>There are 17 species of hedgehog in Europe, Asia and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. Headgehogs are known as the gardener's friend, since they prey on many common garden pests. They are actually considered as wild animals and it is illegal to own a headgehog in some U.S. cities and states.</p>
